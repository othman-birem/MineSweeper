## Getting Started

Hello, this is one of my first humble learning projects as a beginner and i thought that it would be of help to some people to share it in here, So enjoy and don't forget that i'm open to any questions or clarifications about this project or any other that i might be familiar with , We learn together.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains three main folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `images`: the folder to maintain image resources for the game

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
